The make file has two rules for Function Call Analysis, Arguments count check and Type 
checking. 

The rules and paths of them are as follows:
------------------------------------------

make typeCheck

make funcCall -- Prints the name of the functions and also the number of times the functions have been called in that particular file. 


make typeCheck -- First checks the correctness of the number of arguments passed by the caller and actual number of arguments in the function definition. 
It also checks if the type of arguemnts are different. 


The tests directory contains the required test .c files. There is a makefile too.

The command: make mytest2.bc
compiles two files and links them for the purpose of checking. They have all the required type of discrepancies that the two passes check. 

Procedure: 

//in directory test: 

make mytest2.bc				// Compiled with the -g (Clang) option for debugging purposes. 

// In directory lib

make
make funcCall
make typeCheck


// Any changes to the test file can be done to either mytest2a.c or mytest2b.c.
